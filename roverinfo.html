							<h2>Curiosity</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Curiosity is a car sized robotic rover that landed on Mars August 6, 2012. It is the largest and most advanced rover sent to Space to date. After traveling over 350,000,000 miles from Earth,  Curiosity landed a mere 1.5 miles from it's intended touchdown target.  The Curiosity's mission is to investigate the Martian climate and geology, assess if Mars environmental conditions have ever been favorable for microbial life and acquire information regarding the planetary habitability in preparation for future human exploration. As of December 2012, Curiosity's 2-year mission was extended indefinitely and it continues to send home information about the barren Martian landscape to this day.

							<h2>Opprotunity</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover – B) or MER-1, is a robotic rover active on Mars since 2004. Launched on July 7, 2003 as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A) touched down on the other side of the planet. With a planned 90 sol duration of activity, Spirit functioned until getting stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while Opportunity remains active as of 2016, having already exceeded its operating plan by 12 years, 143 days (in Earth time). Opportunity has continued to move, gather scientific observations, and report back to Earth for almost 50 times its designed lifespan.

							<h2>Spirit</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Spirit, also known as MER-A (Mars Exploration Rover – A) or MER-2, is a robotic rover on Mars, active from 2004 to 2010. It was one of two rovers of NASA's ongoing Mars Exploration Rover Mission. It landed successfully on Mars at 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, Opportunity (MER-B), landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition. The rover became stuck in late 2009, and its last communication with Earth was sent on March 22, 2010.
